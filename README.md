# **Hi there, I'm Goottsy <3**

I'm a 20 year old developer, currently a **developer and configurator of Minecraft** events for different streamers and content creators.

I have experience creating **Minecraft plugins** for the PaperMC, BungeeCord and Spigot APIs working in conjunction with databases like **MySQL or MongoDB**.

I also have various hobbies such as a **music producer**, **graphic designer** and sometimes stream on the **Twitch platform**.
